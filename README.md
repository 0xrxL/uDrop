# uDrop

## What's this? 🤔

```uDrop``` was born as private C# project, under the name of ```uPatcher``` in mid-2022, after the ```Vanced Team``` closure.

Its main goal was (and still is) to create a modded YouTube app, based on my personal vision with a few, yet essential, mods (some of which were also developed by me), in order to make the app decently usable. In practice: the stock version that never was. 😁

```uDrop``` follows the old philosophy of the ```Vanced Team``` to build their mods: with a dedicated C# project.

In the end, ```uDrop``` doesn't want to compete with other Android patchers (it wouldn't be possible in any case, due to its different operating mechanisms).  
```uDrop``` simply aims to be a tribute to the past work of the ```Vanced Team``` (and, above all, a personal patcher I can use to test new YouTube beta versions with minimal effort).

## Notes 📒

1) Before using uDrop YouTube, make sure to install [Morphe MicroG](https://github.com/MorpheApp/MicroG-RE/releases/latest).

2) This project was originally designed to remain private, and has therefore has always remained without documentation...  
   uDrop will likely never get documentation, because my free time only allows me to focus on the code and not writing comments.
